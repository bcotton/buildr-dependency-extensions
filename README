This is a spike on creating a buildr extension that can transitively create a full list of dependencies with the following requirements:

1) Compile dependencies along with runtime dependencies are added to runtime dependencies
2) Test dependencies along with runtime dependencies and compile dep. are added to test dependencies
3) The first two list must be resolved transitively
4) Conflicts must be resolved either using the highest available version or by asking questions interactively
