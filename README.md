# Introduction:
This is a Buildr extension that will convert Buildr to transitively resolve dependencies. I built it so I can easily move my projects from maven to buildr. Furthermore, there is a pom generator that can generate a complete pom including the project dependencies with the right scope. I found these tasks to be easy to carry by hand but tedious at the same time given that dependencies tend to change as the project evolve.

See the [Usage wiki section](https://github.com/jvshahid/buildr-dependency-extensions/wiki) for examples.
